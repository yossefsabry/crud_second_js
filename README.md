## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the application consists of the following elements:

- A container `<div>` that encloses the entire application.
- A header section containing a title and description.
- A form section with input fields for collecting product information.
- A table for displaying the list of products.
- A `<script>` tag at the end, linking to a JavaScript file called "script.js" for handling the application logic.

## CSS Styles

The CSS code provides styling for various elements in the application, including:

- Background color, font family, and padding/margin properties.
- Media queries for responsive layout adjustments.

## JavaScript Logic (script.js)

The JavaScript code includes the following functionality:

- Variable declarations to reference HTML elements.
- The `checkTotal` function, which calculates the total price based on input field values.
- The `collectData` function, triggered by a click event on the "create" button, to collect and store product data in the local storage.
- The `showData` function, which retrieves product data from the local storage, generates an HTML table, and updates the table in the DOM.
- Functions for deleting a single row, deleting all rows, and updating a row in the table.
- Manipulation of the `dataStorage` array and updating the local storage accordingly.
